# Open Source Transparency Software for EV Charging Infrastructure (EVSE-TS)

**Really Transparent EV Charging**

Open Source project for the development of a transparency-software for the validation of metering and billing for electric mobility charging sessions.

## Why Open Source?

The software is developed in form of a open-source project with all the requirements and source code hosted in a public repository and provided under a open-source license.

### These are some of the advantages:

 * Neutral and non-competetive environment in which all market players can work together
 * Avoid monopolies and keep the market entrance barrier low
 * Contributions from all relevant market actors lead to solutions meeting all requirements.
 * The chosen license leads to high planning reliability for future developments of new products and tariffs.
 * A transparent development process increases the trust in the software for users and market partners.
 * Access to the source code for everyone helps to locate and resolve bugs.

## What does EV Charging need?

The charging infrastructure market has based on its history and diverse products and services very special requirements towards a common transparency software. The very limiting requirements from the calibration law have to be fulfilled while leaving room for the evolvement of new products and business models. Therefore the following requirements towards a commonly acceptable transparency software are:

 * Compliance to all calibration law requirements
 * Standardized, flexible and open data format for the input values
 * Wide acceptance of the software (standard) for universal use
 * Support for Roaming-scenarios and B2B2C pricing
 * Flexibility in tariff models
 * Compatibility to all/multiple smart meters
 * Compatibility of all hardware manufacturers
 * Modular architecture for future extensions and re-use in more complex scenarios (new tariffs, V2G, etc)
 * Backwards-compatibility of newer versions to allow for maximum flexibility
 * Possibility for custom branding
 * An GUI for the end-user, an API for the backend


## Project plan

 1. Requirements alignment
 2. Definition of a flexible data format for the software
 3. Implementation of a modular software base
 4. Implementation of the first validation modules for current use cases
 5. Preparation of the public user documentation
 6. Type approval of the initial software version with the legal bodies
